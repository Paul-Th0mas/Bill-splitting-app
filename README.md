# Bill Splitting App
I'm working on a Bill Splitting App project using NestJS and React. This project serves as a learning experience for me, allowing me to dive into NestJS and React while gaining insights into the entire project lifecycleâ€”from inception to completion. Through this hands-on approach, I'm tackling challenges as they arise, gaining practical knowledge and overcoming obstacles in real time. It's not just about learning the technologies but also understanding the process of starting, developing, and finishing a project, encountering and resolving difficulties along the way.
